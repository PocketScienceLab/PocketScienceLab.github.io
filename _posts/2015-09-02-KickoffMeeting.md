This meeting gathered 30 of the 50 OpenDreamKit participants, together
with a couple external person. See the [Participants
list](/meetings/2015-09-02-Kickoff/participants).

Many of them had never met in person before. The objective was to build
a joint vision by giving each participant an overview of the
consortium and its wide variety of expertise, and of the project's
aims and specific tasks, as well as to expose them with key software
components, web platforms and technologies in the ecosystem. For
details as well as presentation slides, see the
[Program](/meetings/2015-09-02-Kickoff/program).

We also discussed the management structure, technical infrastructure,
and planning. And we got to work -- finally! -- on some collaborative
tasks, through brainstorms and coding sprints. For notes on the
discussions and sprints, see the [Projects
page](/meetings/2015-09-02-Kickoff/projects).
